# Gapminder Statistical Modeling
## Objective

### Part 1: Visualizing multiple variables and assessing goodness of fit on models 
* Create an interactive slider plot to show babies per woman vs % children alive at age 5 over the years
* Create an interactive selector plot to show GDP per day vs life expectancy over the years
* Fit and plot models for the babies per woman vs % children alive at age 5 data for the year of 1985
* Compare different models through goodness of fit

### Part 2: Techniques used in machine learning
* Cross validation
* Logistic regression
* Bayesian inference
