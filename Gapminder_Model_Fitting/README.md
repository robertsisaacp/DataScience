# Gapminder Statistical Modeling
## Objective

### Part 1: Visualizing multiple variables and assessing goodness of fit on models 
* Create an interactive slider plot to show babies per woman vs % children alive at age 5 over the years
* Create an interactive selector plot to show GDP per day vs life expectancy over the years
* Fit and plot models for the babies per woman vs % children alive at age 5 data for the year of 1985
* Compare different models through goodness of fit

### Part 2: Analyze Model with Cross Validation and Bayesian Inference
* Perform cross validation on 4 different models for this dataset
* Visualize uncertainty in Bayesian inference of 10000 samples

### Part 3: Logistic Regression on Wickham Dataset
* Convert smoking outcome to binary numbers and perform model fitting
* Perform logistic regressionn and limit the output model to values between 0 and 1 that can be understood as the probability of 1 of the 2 outcomes
