# Image Recognition with Keras
## Objective: 

* Play with buit-in Keras' ResNet50 model that was pre-trained against the ImageNet database
* Using the CIFAR-10 database, build our own Neural Network to recognize 10 different categories of things: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, boat, truck

This challenge is taken from Adam Geitgey's course "Deep Learning: Image Recognition" on Lynda.com
