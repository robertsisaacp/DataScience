Step 1: Preprocess data by scaling training input and outputs; and transform test data accordingly
Step 2: Create empty instance of model object and add neural network layers; compile
Step 3: Train model and test error rate using mean squared error
Step 4: Save model to use for future predictions
Step 5: Load saved model and use on new data
