# Email analytics challenge

An election in taking place and we are asked to poll our co-citizens for their vote. We are going to assume that we can reach every voter by phoneand that every poll voter replies truthfully.

## Objective

* Analyze smaller and larger dataset to see who has a better chance of winning the election by simulating 1000 elections
* Test the null hypothesis of Green winning the election with the smaller polling data set
* Test the null hypothesis of Brown winning the election with the larger polling data set
* Bootstrap polling data to find confidence interval of grades
* Justify use of bootstrapping on this datase
* Estimate the confidence interval for the fraction of citizens that give mayor Green a passing grade
