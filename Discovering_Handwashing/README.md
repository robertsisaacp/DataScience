# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
## Introduction
Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. He discovered that a disease known as childbed fever, which claimed the lives of up to 10% of mothers giving birth, could be drastically reduced if physicians washed their hands! In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing.
